# Trespasser Detection Using Deep Learning

ðŸš€ A deep learning-based trespasser detection system that leverages computer vision for security applications.

## Features
- Real-time trespasser detection using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs)
- Supports both video and image inputs
- Customizable for different environments
- Can be deployed as a web application using Flask/FastAPI

## Installation
To get started, clone the repository and install the dependencies:
I have also given a yolo.ipynb file for instructions

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/Trespasser-Detection-DeepLearning.git
cd Trespasser-Detection-DeepLearning
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage
Run the detection script on an image or video or using a webcam:

```bash
app.py 
```
